# Basic-HTML-Layout


This is a first website project I created in March 2023 for the MIT Full Stack Web Development Course.

It is a simple webpage that incorporates CSS. It introduces my favorite musical artists and a few of my favoirte songs from them.
This website demonstrates beginners knowledge in website development and will be used to show my progress throughout the course!

To open the website, click the file titled "website"

To see the CSS file, click the file titled "style"

To see the image files, click the files that end in "img"
